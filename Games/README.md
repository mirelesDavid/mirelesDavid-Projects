# Game Projects

This repository contains two game projects implemented in C++: a Snake game and a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## 1. Snake Game

The Snake game is a classic game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The objective is to navigate the snake through the game board without running into walls or its own body.

### Features

- Retro-style console graphics
- Score tracking
- Game over detection (hitting walls or the snake's body)
- Smooth movement and control

### Controls

- `W` or `Up Arrow`: Move the snake upward
- `A` or `Left Arrow`: Move the snake to the left
- `S` or `Down Arrow`: Move the snake downward
- `D` or `Right Arrow`: Move the snake to the right

### Setup and Execution

1. Compile the Snake game source code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable file.
3. The game will start, and you can use the controls mentioned above to play.

## 2. Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the grid, and the first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

### Features

- Console-based game board
- Player vs. Player mode
- Move input using keyboard keys
- Win, draw, and turn indication

### Controls

- `Q`: Place a mark in the top-left cell
- `W`: Place a mark in the top-middle cell
- `E`: Place a mark in the top-right cell
- `A`: Place a mark in the middle-left cell
- `S`: Place a mark in the center cell
- `D`: Place a mark in the middle-right cell
- `Z`: Place a mark in the bottom-left cell
- `X`: Place a mark in the bottom-middle cell
- `C`: Place a mark in the bottom-right cell
- `M`: Exit the game

### Setup and Execution

1. Compile the Tic-Tac-Toe game source code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable file.
3. The game will start, and players can take turns making moves using the keyboard controls.
