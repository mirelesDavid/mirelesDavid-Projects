# Intelligent Traffic Light System for Emission Reduction

## Overview
This project aims to implement an Intelligent Traffic Light System utilizing Machine Learning techniques to optimize traffic flow and reduce CO2 emissions. By predicting optimal traffic light timings, we aim to minimize wait times for vehicles, thereby reducing congestion and emissions.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes linear regression to predict optimal traffic light timings based on traffic data.
- **Arduino Firebase Integration**: Files for integrating Arduino with Firebase for real-time data communication.
- **Firebase Integration**: Firebase files for real-time data storage and retrieval.
- **ML Linear Regression**: Files related to the machine learning implementation using linear regression.

## Project Structure
- `Arduino_Firebase/`: Directory containing files for Arduino Firebase integration.
- `Firebase/`: Firebase files for real-time data storage and retrieval.
- `ML_Linear_Regression/`: Files related to the machine learning implementation using linear regression.
